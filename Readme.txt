How to run the code:

1. Unzip cv_project.zip and upload it to google drive without changing the folder name(cv_project) in My Drive.
2. Go to the uploaded cv_project and open 'run_on_colab.ipynb' with google colab.
3. Run the 1st cell and give authorization to access to colab.
4. Run all the remaining cells.
5. The code is expected to run for ~10hrs for 20,000 epochs.
6. The output video  will be generated in My Drive/cv_project/files
